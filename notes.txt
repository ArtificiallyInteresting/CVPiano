I should experiment with having it cutoff right when it stops seeing the object, vs when the sound would finish normally

Bs are poorly recognized, the system thinks that they are Fs
Add some scaling on letter/texture mapping. Just 10% expanded and 10% reduced should be fine
Better music tones, the repeating piano is meh.

I like the idea of having an inconsistent font. If every letter is a different font, they'll be easier to distinguish
